/*
	Rest is a toolkit for building restful APIs focused on dealing with application
	and business logic whilst avoiding dealing with messy and repettetive http/REST
	handling.

	The Store/Collection interfaces are aimed at providing swappable storage backends
	with no code changes on actual models and application logic (though some struct
	tags would have to be modified depending on eventual serialization format).

// Model is the minimal interface your API's documents must satisfy to allow the
// RESTful handlers to manage modification and storage. there are further optional
// interfaces you can satisfy [PreSaver, PostSaver, Validator, Permissioner] to
// allow more complex custom behaviours to your documents

// and Modification. it also usually contains a connection or collection instance
// from things like mongodb, so may contain state. this should be checked before usage

// permission levels from an external service.
